<h2> &#128269; About the project </h2><br>

<p> Project carried out during the Bachelor of Information Technology (BTI)
for the subject Programming Language I. This is a program made in C++ that simulates a playlist manager. The program 
does not deal with real music files, it just creates objects that represent a song using a title 
and the name of the artist/band. You can create playlist, manage music and run created playlists.</p>
