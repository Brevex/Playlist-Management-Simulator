<h2> &#128269; About the project </h2><br>

<p>A simple C++ program that simulates a playlist manager. The program 
does not deal with real music files, it just creates objects that represent a song using a title 
and the name of the artist/band. You can create playlist, manage music and run created playlists.</p>

<h2> &#128296; Dependencies and Execution </h2><br>

<p>To compile and run this program on your machine, you will need CMake and
the code compiler for C/C++, which can be gcc or g++. To create the executable
go to the "build" folder, right click and open the terminal
inside that folder. With the terminal open, type "cmake.." and press enter, then
type "make" and hit enter again. Finally, type "./manager" to run
the program.</p><br>
